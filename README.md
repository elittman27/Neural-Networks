# Neural-Networks
Derives and implements neural networks with arbitrarily deep layers. Enables forward and backward propagation to make predictions and compute the gradient of the network respectively. Uses Cross Entropy Loss for the cost function and exposes different activation functions including SoftMax, ReLU, and Sigmoid.
